# Project Proposal for iOS PT3 Build Sprint

1. Fork and Clone this repository
2. Fill out the information below
3. Tag your TL and Instructor on your Pull Request

## Requirements

1. Do you want to work Solo or on a Team: `<team>`
2. [App Idea](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/iOS-Build-Week-1): `<Countdown>`
3. App Description (3-5 sentences):
    A simple app that can control and organize time countdowns.
    Maybe make a app that regulates whenever you can have a cigarette? A moderation app.
    Completely sherlocked idea by apple themselves, but I feel it would still be a good project.
4. Target Audience: (Who would want to use the app?)
EVERYONE

## Brainstorming

Add photos, notes, and sketches from your brain storming session.

## Project Plan
1. List out your tasks
2. Organize your tasks by priority
    1. Add subtasks
    2. Be specific. Every goal should be concrete, otherwise it's not actionable. 
    3. Break down large tasks into smaller tasks that you can "cross off".
3. You won't be able to do everything, focus on ~3 features / 3-5 screens that you can finish
4. Re-evaluate your progress each day and plan what you'll work on the next day
