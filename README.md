# Project Proposal for iOS PT3 Build Sprint

1. Fork and Clone this repository
2. Fill out the information below
3. Tag your TL and Instructor on your Pull Request

## Requirements

1. Do you want to work Solo or on a Team: 
    `Solo`

2. [App Idea](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/iOS-Build-Week-1): 
    `medication tracker`

3. App Description (3-5 sentences): 
    I want to create an app that lists and alerts you when you have to take inputed medication. I want to display the days of the week and list mediactions for those days and reasons why you are taking those meds, set time limits and possibly notify client of refills.

    1. Explain it to your Grandma or a 5-year old child
    This is an app that helps you keep track of your medication schedule. All you have to do is click on the day and add your medication or add a medication and schedule the days and the time you have to take your medication. You will get an alert when its time to take your medication.
    
4. Target Audience: (Who would want to use the app?)
    Anyone who needs to keep track of medication taken

## Brainstorming

Add photos, notes, and sketches from your brain storming session. 

1. Brainstorming (Photo / Sketch)
    1. 15 min: Mind Map 
    2. 15 min: Organize ideas
    3. 10 min: Sketch mock ups 
2. If you have tons of ideas, set a timer again and keep going.
3. Don't filter yourself in the brainstorming phase, you want to capture everything and anything

## Project Plan
1. List out your tasks
2. Organize your tasks by priority
    1. Add subtasks
    2. Be specific. Every goal should be concrete, otherwise it's not actionable. 
    3. Break down large tasks into smaller tasks that you can "cross off".
3. You won't be able to do everything, focus on ~3 features / 3-5 screens that you can finish
4. Re-evaluate your progress each day and plan what you'll work on the next day
