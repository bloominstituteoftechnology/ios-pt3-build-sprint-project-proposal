# Project Proposal for iOS PT3 Build Sprint

1. Fork and Clone this repository
2. Fill out the information below
3. Tag your TL and Instructor on your Pull Request

## Requirements

1. Do you want to work Solo or on a Team: `<solo>`
2. [App Idea](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/iOS-Build-Week-1): `<Home Mortgage Calculator>`
3. App Description (3-5 sentences):
My calculator will be basic.  User will enter: 1. the dollar amount of the mortgage, 2. the interest rate(%), and 3. The mortgage length in years.  The app will return your monthly payment.
    1. Explain it to your Grandma or a 5-year old child
4. Target Audience: (Who would want to use the app?)
It will target a rough age range of 25-45 years old, but really anyone that is looking to buy a home.

## Brainstorming

Add photos, notes, and sketches from your brain storming session. 

1. Brainstorming (Photo / Sketch)

    2. 15 min: Organize ideas
    3. 10 min: Sketch mock ups

    Calculator view should look something like this:

2. If you have tons of ideas, set a timer again and keep going.
3. Don't filter yourself in the brainstorming phase, you want to capture everything and anything

## Project Plan
1. List out your tasks
2. Organize your tasks by priority
    1. Add subtasks
    2. Be specific. Every goal should be concrete, otherwise it's not actionable. 
    3. Break down large tasks into smaller tasks that you can "cross off".
3. You won't be able to do everything, focus on ~3 features / 3-5 screens that you can finish
4. Re-evaluate your progress each day and plan what you'll work on the next day
