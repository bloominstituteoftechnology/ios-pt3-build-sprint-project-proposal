## Project Plan
1. List out your tasks
"Decide what all features we want to add,
Gather the assets we need to complete our scenes,
Gather the intel we need to be able to execute the challenge at hand
Get to coding everything in that we want to add,
"
2. Organize your tasks by priority
    1. Add subtasks
    2. Be specific. Every goal should be concrete, otherwise it's not actionable. 
    3. Break down large tasks into smaller tasks that you can "cross off".
3. You won't be able to do everything, focus on ~3 features / 3-5 screens that you can finish
4. Re-evaluate your progress each day and plan what you'll work on the next day
